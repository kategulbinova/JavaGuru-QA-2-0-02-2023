			<p>Lithuania is the largest Baltic state. Despite the fact that the country is not one step behind the progressive European development (just think of how much it costs to have free Wi-Fi in the whole territory), the local population treats myths and legends with care. People here believe in harmony between nature and man. For example, the neighborhoods of Palanga and Neringa are considered to be the most ecologically-clean places in Europe. There are five national parks and 30 regional parks in Lithuania, almost all beaches have the "Blue Flag", which indicates exemplary cleanliness and safety. It is no wonder that the country is secretly recognized as a Baltic health resort: every year, hundreds of thousands of tourists come here to have a rest and improve their health at the best SPA resorts of the Baltic States
