			<br>
				<p1>Three countries on the shores of the Baltic Sea â€“ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania may be surprisingly contrasting, but all three are united by their common history going back many centuries, and the joint struggle for independence. To fully experience the Baltic flavour, one should visit all three.The unspoiled scenery of the Baltic coast, the living culture and traditions, and the heritage left behind by the former superpowers make the Baltics an attractive tourist destination.
