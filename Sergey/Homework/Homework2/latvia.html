					<br>
			<p>Latvia lies in Eastern Europe and shares its coastline with the Baltic Sea & the Gulf of Riga. It shares land borders with Lithuania, Estonia, Russia & Belarus.
					<br>
The capital of Latvia – Riga – the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the Baltic States – was founded in 1201. With its handsome integration of medieval and contemporary architecture, Riga is considered the world’s best collection of the Art Nouveau!
					<br>
Although Latvia is a small country located on the Baltic Sea, it has ancient traditions and a long history dating back to early 9,000 BC. Latvia is an interesting travel destination because of its wide range of leisure and business travel opportunities.You can enjoy your trip to Latvia in different ways – city sightseeing tours in Riga historical centre, romantic travel in SPA hotels all over the country, or family holiday in the guest houses on the countryside of Latvia.
					<br>
The unspoiled scenery of the Baltic coast, the living culture and traditions, and the heritage left behind by the former superpowers make the Baltics an attractive tourist destination.
