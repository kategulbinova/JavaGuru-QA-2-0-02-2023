                    Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta, Jainism and Mahayana Buddhism, thus making it, according to some,
                    a Hindu text par excellence. The text is considered as one of the most important texts in Indian
                    philosophy and literature. The text is also notable for its discussion of the nature of reality and
                    the universe, and its use of parables and stories to illustrate its points. The text is also notable

                    The name Vasistha in the title of the text refers to Rishi Vasistha. The term Yoga in the text
                    refers to the underlying Yogic theme in its stories and dialogues, and the term is used in a generic
                    sense to include all forms of yoga in the pursuit of liberation, in the style of Bhagavad Gita.
                    The long version of the text is called Brihat Yoga Vasistha, wherein Brihat means "great or large".
                    The short version of the text is called Laghu Yoga Vasishta, wherein Laghu means "short or
                    small". The longer version is also referred to simply as Yoga Vasistha and by numerous other
                    names such as Vasiṣṭha Ramayana.
