                The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog,
                it is derived from extinct gray wolves, and the gray wolf is the dog's closest living relative. The dog was the first species
                to be domesticated by humans. Hunter-gatherers did this over 15,000 years ago in Oberkassel, Bonn, which was before the development
                of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained
                the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
