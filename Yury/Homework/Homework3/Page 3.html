<b>BHeartbreak House: A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes</b> is a play written by George Bernard Shaw, first published in 1919. The English language premiere was at the Garrick Theatre in November 1920. According to A. C. Ward, the work argues that "cultured, leisured Europe" was drifting toward destruction, and that "Those in a position to guide Europe to safety failed to learn their proper business of political navigation".[1] The "Russian manner" of the subtitle refers to the style of Anton Chekhov, which Shaw adapts.
